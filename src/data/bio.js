    info: 'I have worked in Power Plant (YCCPP) as Power Engineer for 8 years after i graduated from Yerevan State Engineering University in 2009 .One and a half years ago i decided to switch  to Software Engineering. The moment i have really got into coding was when i came to China and met Jimmy Keesee in November 2019 who helped me to gain confidence in coding . I have learned lot of staff during the time i have been in Zhongxi for instance  Redux, Redux-Saga, NodeJs, Express, MongoDb ... and worked on my own projects. Currently i am looking for the place where i can hone my coding skills and work on real world applications.',
